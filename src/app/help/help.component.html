					<p>You can check the list of routers in Routers section, also you can see your first 10 routers ( sorted by ID ) in the Dashboard section.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>To add or remove router(s) you have to navigate to the Routers section, input router name and press ADD, after it has been done,
            router will appear on the router list in which you can delete it by pressing the Delete button right next to it.
          </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How to login?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>There is no server side verification for logging in, as there is no real database currently supporting this application.
          Angular is intercepting all HTTP requests to the database and instead it serves information from a "mock database", which is why any progress
          or edits you make on the site, will be cleared and restored with the information in the mock database after service restart. 
          </p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Practice. This was made following the basic angular tutorial, but with my own touches as I learned everything on the go. Technically, it does 
            serve a purpose - it helps you track routers you are currently testing in RMA/ENDURANCE or wherever else. Let's say, you previously put all 
            your ongoing tests on a notepad, now you can still put them on the notepad, but make angular serve it to the project as your mock-database,
             so instead of fetching real "fake data", it fetches real data of your current routers.
